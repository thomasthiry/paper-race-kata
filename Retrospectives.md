# 8/10/2020

- I learned about an immutable Builder (pattern did occur to me yet)
- I learned about the tool to migrate from camel case to snake case <3
- I liked how we improved our collaboration
- I did learn about immutability (putting all invariants in the constructor)
- I <3 Anydesk +1+1+1
- I finally practiced builder pattern
- I liked that the next navigator decides when to start the next iteration (to avoid endless discussions between iteration)
- I liked that we were less strict on timing (so we could finish what we were doing)

## Idea

- explicit check-in at the begin at the session 
	- what do you wanna learn?
	- which approach do you wanna follow?
