Like/Learn
- SignalR, easy once it works
- Hard reload
- Babysteps to make it work, even without unit tests it is a good idea
- Switching on natural points, combined with babysteps
- Game is a bit playable
- Collaboration is a bit more fluent
- Idea explored before we try something new
- Timer -> Natural switch: less need to take a break before we start the next navigation
- Good to meet
- Ideas sometimes get lost if you cannot try immediatly
- Start machine automatically

- I learned about an immutable Builder (pattern did occur to me yet)
- I learned about the tool to migrate from camel case to snake case <3
- I liked how we improved our collaboration
- I did learn about immutability (putting all invariants in the constructor)
- I <3 Anydesk +1+1+1
- I finally practiced builder pattern
- I liked that the next navigator decides when to start the next iteration (to avoid endless discussions between iteration)
- I liked that we were less strict on timing (so we could finish what we were doing)

## Idea

- explicit check-in at the begin at the session 
	- what do you wanna learn?
	- which approach do you wanna follow?


* liked : 
    tests and implementation are more complete
	improved clarity of both tests & impl.

	clear focus - thx to objective at start (+1)
	    detail of the list indeed not necessary (default to action)

	when we moved forward (default to action ! )

	spend a lot of time on naming (+1,5)

	felt more aligned with what whole group was doing (better than last time)

	aligments enabled faster moving forward

	being encouraged to default to action

	question for break (+1)

	having lot's of fun :)


* learned
	we need to put more time in keyboard config / tech setup

	start to mob with new group feels cumbersome (always takes a few mobs (10+) before it feels natural)

	when applying an idea - wait with new idea's until 1st idea is applied.  (mikado ?)

	hard to commit to others ideas and to defend them - we undid much of what was done before. If the MOB changes, the ideas are hard to maintain / explain / ...
		--> Sometimes just follow along without understanding why

	team changes lead to questioning things

	new team members can learn faster by taking the keyboard

* curious 
	to see if researching together is interesting enough
